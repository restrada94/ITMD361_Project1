Cholula Massacre: Short Paper

Objectively, the Spanish were making their way towards Tenochtitlan. However, the two
tales of the events in Cholula were vastly different. Tapia’s version shows the massacre was in a
justified response for the planned betrayal and murder of the Spanish and allies by the Cholulans
at the command of Moctezuma’s scouts. Women and children were allegedly spared. This
version portrays Hernan and his men as justified in their actions, and in no way initiated the
violence that took place. In contrast, Sahagun’s codex recognizes how armed and thirsty for
wealth the Spanish were. Even if pigs were not an animal known in pre-conquest Latin America,
there were mentions of the Spanish taking gold gifts like frenzied pigs (Paraphrased). Therefore,
from the start the Spanish were portrayed differently. It is worth noting the codex describes the
Spanish as heavily armed wearing plate armor, wielding crossbows, guns and modern
technology. Perhaps this is the reason why the Tlaxcalans took them into their city and offered
gifts, but also what might have contributed to this disposition, could be the fact that the Otomi,
who were a people of Tlaxcala, some of their best warriors, were decimated easily when they
attacked the Spanish probably out of suspicion and distrust. This being said, the Spanish were
told by the Tlaxcalans how the Cholulans were their enemy and needed to be dealt with. I
suspect, in order to preserve their only base of operations in a foreign unknown land, the Spanish
slaughtered Cholola’s population as a gesture to preserve bonds with Tlaxcala. There is
uncertainty if they were violent or only used violence as a resort to elevate their position. I think
the latter makes more sense, since even the codex said that after the massacre, the Spanish and
allies had a peaceful journey towards the capital.
Both versions of events had certain biases which threatened to make them both unusable
as sources. Tapia’s version was written for a judge during a trial of Cortez, so not only would
Tapia place his commander under a bright, positive light out of respect, but would also try to
reduce evidence in an effort to prevent incriminating Cortez. Similarly, the Codex was written
based on stories by descendants of people who were not allied with the Mexica, many years after
the events. Women and children were not spared, and their remains were found on site
(Berenberg). This is one of the largest giveaways to disprove and render Tapia’s version
unreliable. Even I believe that because Tapia was trying to defend Corez in court, his version
proves more unreliable that the account of the natives, even if they were not allied to the Mexica.
